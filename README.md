## Directory Structure

### Codes_and_Results

Codes and results of running each method.

### Data_analysis

Data analysis and its results.

### Dataset

Proposed dataset with feature definitions and formulas.


## How to Use

To run the code for each approach:

1. **Navigate to the Respective Code Folder:** Go to the directory related to the specific method you want to run.

2. **Execute "main.py":** Run the "main.py" file within that folder.

   This will create a directory named "Results" where the program's output will be organized in each step.

After completing the execution of "main.py" for each method, you can visualize the final results of each method by running the **"generating_results_tables.ipynb"** file section by section using **Jupyter Notebook**.

Finally, you should run the **"generating_all_results.ipynb"** file to aggregate and analyze the results together.   

Enjoy exploring the results!

The dataset has been prepared by [Kamran Abdi](https://github.com/Rayan1392), and the implementation has been done by [Hossein Rezaei](https://github.com/HosseinRezaei951).
